# BuckWise ðŸ’°
BuckWise is an iOS app designed and developed to help you keep track of your daily expenses.
Why stress when you can buckwisely spend every month? ;) <br />

**DEMO: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p-dYtxJCJgF0-_7Qvq1lQnq-lyWpTQku/view?usp=sharing**

The development of this app can be broken down into 6 stages namely:
- Sketching
- Wireframing
- Final design
- Development
- User testing
- Go-Live <br /> <br />

## Sketching
Sketches for BuckWise have been roughly made for the understanding of the developer (which is me). Sketched a 4 page app that looks like this:

## Wireframing
The initial design of BuckWise is tackled by utilizing Figma to create box-like wireframes to kick off. Here is a live demo of the wireframes:<br />
